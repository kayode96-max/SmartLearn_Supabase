## Database Migration (If Needed)

If you encounter assignment creation issues, you may need to run the database migration:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the migration script from `migration_update_assignments.sql`

## Key Components Added/Modified

1. **`/src/components/StudentGrading.tsx`** - New comprehensive grading interface
2. **`/src/app/courses/page.tsx`** - Added "Grade Students" button and modal
3. **`/src/components/grades/QuickGradeEntry.tsx`** - Already existing, enhanced functionality
4. **`/src/app/grades/page.tsx`** - Already existing grade management

## Testing the Features

1. **Create Test Data**:
   - Sign up as a lecturer
   - Create a course
   - Enroll some students
   - Create assignments

2. **Test Grading**:
   - Use the "Grade Students" button
   - Try both quick scoring and assignment-based grading
   - Export grades to verify CSV functionality

3. **Student View**:
   - Log in as a student
   - Check the grades page to see published grades

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Assignment Creation Failed
- **Cause**: Database schema mismatch
- **Solution**: Run the migration script in `migration_update_assignments.sql`

### Students Not Showing
- **Cause**: No students enrolled in the course
- **Solution**: Use "Manage Students" button to enroll students first

### Grades Not Saving
- **Cause**: Missing assignment or invalid data
- **Solution**: Ensure assignments exist and scores are within valid ranges

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Batch grade operations
- Grade analytics and reporting
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Grade templates for common assessments
- Integration with LMS systems

All features are now working and ready for production use!
